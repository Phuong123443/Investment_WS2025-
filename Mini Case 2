    "## Mini Case 02: Orion Semiconductor – The Silicon Cliff\n",
    "\n",
    "**Date:** November 1, 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "Orion Semiconductor is a legacy chip manufacturer that specialized in reliable, low-margin automotive chips. To build its latest fabrication plant (\"The Foundry\"), Orion took on massive leverage during the easy-money era.\n",
    "\n",
    "The semiconductor cycle has turned. Demand is slumping, and Orion is currently in the \"Distressed Zone.\" The market value of its factories, inventory, and intellectual property ($V$) fluctuates daily based on global trade tensions and silicon prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your group acts as the Financial Restructuring Team. The company faces a \"debt wall\"—a single massive repayment due in exactly 2 years. The Board needs to determine the fair market value of its distressed debt and equity, and decide on a controversial strategic pivot that pits the interests of shareholders against bondholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "This case requires you to view Corporate Equity as a Call Option on the firm's assets and Corporate Debt as a Risk-Free Bond minus a Put Option on those assets (The Merton Model).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Data Pack\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exhibit A: The Balance Sheet (Market Values)\n",
    "The Merton Model defines the firm as: $V = E + D$ (Asset Value = Equity + Risky Debt).\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Estimated Current Asset Value ($V_0$): $\\$100 \\text{ Million}$\n",
    "    *   *(This is the market value of all factories, inventory, and IP).*\n",
    "*   Debt Structure: A single Zero-Coupon Bond issue.\n",
    "*   Face Value of Debt ($F$): $\\$85 \\text{ Million}$\n",
    "*   Time to Maturity ($T$): 2.0 Years\n",
    "*   Risk-Free Rate ($r_f$): 5.0% (continuously compounded)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exhibit B: The Volatility Estimates\n",
    "*   Asset Volatility ($\\sigma_V$): 40% (Annual)\n",
    "    *   *Note: This is the volatility of the underlying business assets, NOT the stock price volatility (which is leveraged and much higher).*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exhibit C: \"Project Singularity\"\n",
    "Management proposes abandoning the stable automotive chip market to go \"All-In\" on experimental AI Accelerators.\n",
    "*   Impact: This shift increases the Asset Volatility ($\\sigma_V$) from 40% to 70%.\n",
    "*   Cost: The pivot requires no new capital (re-tooling existing lines), $V_0$ remains $\\$100 \\text{ Million}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis & Discussion Points\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. The Discrete View: 2-Period Binomial Tree\n",
    "*Assume the 2-year timeline is divided into two 1-year periods ($\\Delta t = 1$).*\n",
    "\n",
    "a.  **Asset Tree:** Construct a 2-period Binomial Tree for the Asset Value ($V$).\n",
    "    *   Calculate Up ($u$) and Down ($d$) factors: $u = e^{\\sigma_V\\sqrt{\\Delta t}}$, $d = 1/u$.\n",
    "    *   Calculate the risk-neutral probability ($p$): $p = \\frac{e^{r_f \\Delta t} - d}{u - d}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "b.  **Equity Tree:** At maturity ($t=2$), calculate the value of Equity ($E_2$).\n",
    "    *   Note that the shareholders claim the residual value. $E_T = \\max(V_T - F, 0)$.\n",
    "    *   Work backward to find the value of Equity today ($E_0$) using risk-neutral discounting: $E_{t} = e^{-r_f \\Delta t} [p E_{u} + (1-p) E_{d}]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "c.  **Debt Tree:** At maturity ($t=2$), calculate the value of Debt ($D_2$).\n",
    "    *   Note that the bondholders have a senior claim, but cannot claim more than the assets exist. $D_T = \\min(V_T, F)$.\n",
    "    *   Work backward to find the value of Debt today ($D_0$) using risk-neutral discounting.\n",
    "    *   Does $E_0 + D_0$ equal your starting $V_0$?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. The Continuous View: Black-Scholes-Merton\n",
    "*Use the Black-Scholes formulas for European Options to value the capital structure.*\n",
    "\n",
    "a.  **Equity Valuation:** Calculate the value of Orion's Equity ($E_0$) treating it as a Call Option on the Assets ($V_0$) with a Strike Price equal to the Debt Face Value ($F$).\n",
    "\n",
    "b.  **The Default Put:** Calculate the value of the \"Put Option on Assets\" ($P_0$).\n",
    "    *   Shareholders implicitly own a Put option that allows them to default and \"put\" the assets to the bondholders if $V_T < F$.\n",
    "    *   Calculate the Value of Risky Debt ($D_0$): $D_0 \\equiv D_{Risky} = (F \\times e^{-r_f T}) - P_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "c.  **Credit Analysis:**\n",
    "    *   What is the implied Yield to Maturity ($y$) on the Risky Debt (continuously compounded)?\n",
    "    *   What is the Credit Spread ($y - r_f$)?\n",
    "    *   What is the Risk-Neutral Probability of Default ($N(-d_2)$)?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Strategic Conflict: \"Project Singularity\"\n",
    "*Use the Black-Scholes model to analyze the impact of the proposal to increase Asset Volatility ($\\sigma_V$) from 40% to 70%.*\n",
    "\n",
    "a.  **The Wealth Transfer:** Re-calculate the value of Equity ($E_{new}$) and Debt ($D_{new}$) using $\\sigma_V = 70\\%$.\n",
    "    *   Does the total value of the firm ($V_0$) change?\n",
    "    *   How much value was transferred from Bondholders to Shareholders (or vice versa)?\n",
    "\n",
    "b.  **The Agency Problem:** Explain why shareholders might rationally choose \"Project Singularity\" even if it had a slightly negative Net Present Value (e.g., if it lowered $V_0$ to $\\$98 \\text{ Million}$), whereas the Bondholders would reject it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Volatility Smiles & Real World Pricing\n",
    "In option markets, deep out-of-the-money puts often trade at implied volatilities higher than the standard log-normal model predicts (the \"Skew\").\n",
    "\n",
    "*   If investors fear a \"Black Swan\" event (e.g., a total ban on AI chip exports) that could cause assets to gap down instantly, is the Black-Scholes valuation of the Debt likely too high or too low? Explain your reasoning based on the value of the \"Default Put.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Final Verdict\n",
    "\n",
    "Prepare a brief memo to the Board addressing:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Fair Market Pricing:** If a distressed debt fund offered to buy Orion's bonds at 75 cents on the dollar, is that a good deal for the company to buy back its own debt?\n",
    "2.  **Risk-Neutral Default Probability:** Based on your Merton Model calculation, what is the market-implied probability that Orion defaults in 2 years?\n",
    "    *   *(Note: This is the probability derived from asset prices, distinct from \"real-world\" historical default rates).*\n",
    "3.  **Strategic Recommendation:** Should the Board authorize \"Project Singularity\"? Balance the potential upside for equity against the massive degradation of credit quality.\n",
