    "\n",
    "The preceding simulation introduces a statistical layer to our payoff diagrams. While the \"V-shape\" payoff profile tells us *how much* money we make at a specific price, it doesn't tell us *how likely* we are to reach that price.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Technical Notes on the Calculation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Breakeven Points ($BE$):**\n",
    "    The strategy requires the stock to move enough to cover the total premium paid ($Cost$).\n",
    "    *   $BE_{low} = K_{put} - Cost$\n",
    "    *   $BE_{high} = K_{call} + Cost$\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Probability Logic:**\n",
    "    The code calculates the probability that the final stock price ($S_T$) lands in the profit zone (the \"tails\" of the distribution). It uses terms similar to the **Black-Scholes $d_2$** parameter:\n",
    "    *   It measures how many standard deviations the Breakeven point is from the current spot price, adjusted for Time ($T$) and Volatility ($\\sigma$).\n",
    "    *   $Probability = N(d_2)$, where $N$ is the cumulative distribution function.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Simplifying Assumption:**\n",
    "    *   For visualization purposes, this simulation assumes the stock price drift is **zero** (or risk-free). In reality, stocks may have an upward drift (expected return), which would skew the probability slightly in favor of the Call side.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interactive Exercise:**\n",
    "When running the code above, increase the **Implied Volatility (IV)** slider. Watch how the bell curve flattens and widens. This visually demonstrates why higher volatility increases the probability of the stock hitting the extreme profit zones (though in real markets, this would also increase the cost of the option).\n",
